# â˜• Coffee Database Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores a coffee database using both SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB).

The SQL analysis runs structured queries in MySQL to uncover patterns in relational tables, while the NoSQL analysis uses MongoDB to explore the same data in a flexible, document-oriented format. Both approaches examine customer behavior, sales trends, and product characteristics, demonstrating how different database management systems can generate insights to support business decisions.

This repository has two folders, one containing the SQL files and the other containing the NoSQL files. Each folder includes a README.md summarizing the results, a script with the queries, and a file to create and populate the database, providing all the resources needed to reproduce the outputs.
